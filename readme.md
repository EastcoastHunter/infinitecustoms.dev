## Basic Information
> When editing this file structor you don't edit the "index.php" structure, as it is preconfigured and what you want isn't in there anyways.

# Following File Structure
>To edit the site you will go to **`./src/php/<filename>`** to edit the site, dont mess with anything in **`<>`** tags or you will have to pay for me to fix this file structure. 

#
>Once you have access the file you want to edit in **`./src/php/<filename>.html`** you dont want to mess with anything in **`div`** tags **`p`** tags or any words or phrases that start with **`<>`** unless you know what you are doing.
